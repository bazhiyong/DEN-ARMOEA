# Introduction of DNN-AR-MOEA
This repository contains code necessary to reproduce the experiments presented in Evolutionary Optimization of High-DimensionalMulti- and Many-Objective Expensive ProblemsAssisted by a Dropout Neural Network.
Gaussian  processes  are  widely  used  in  surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization of expensive problems. We  propose  a  computationally efficient dropout neural network (EDN) to replace the Gaussian process  and  a  new  model  management  strategy  to  achieve  a good  balance  between  convergence  and  diversity  for  assisting evolutionary  algorithms  to  solve  high-dimensional  multi-  and many-objective expensive optimization problems. mainlydue  to  the  ability  to  provide  a  confidence  level  of  their  outputs,making  it  possible  to  adopt  principled  surrogate  managementmethods  such  as  the  acquisition  function  used  in  Bayesian  opti-mization.  Unfortunately,  Gaussian  processes  become  less  practi-cal for high-dimensional multi- and many-objective optimizationas  their  computational  complexity  is  cubic  in  the  number  oftraining  samples.
